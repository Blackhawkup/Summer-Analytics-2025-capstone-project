 🚗 Dynamic Pricing for Urban Parking Lots

This project was developed as part of Summer Analytics 2025 Capstone Project, hosted by Consulting & Analytics Club × Pathway.

Our goal: build a real-time intelligent pricing engine for 14 urban parking lots using demand patterns, environmental context, and competitive pricing — without any ML libraries.

 🔍 Project Overview

Urban parking is chaotic — fixed prices lead to overcrowding or underuse. We solve this by simulating a dynamic pricing engine that adjusts rates in real-time using:

- Occupancy levels
- Queue length
- Traffic conditions
- Special days/events
- Vehicle types
- Nearby competitor lot prices
